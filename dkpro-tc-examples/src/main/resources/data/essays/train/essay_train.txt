8	Dear local newspaper, I think effects computers have on people are great learning skills/affects because they give us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe(astronomy) and keeps us out of troble! Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place. Now I hope you have reached a point to understand and agree with me, because computers can have great effects on you or child because it gives us time to chat with friends/new people, helps us learn about the globe and believe or not keeps us out of troble. Thank you for listening.
9	In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?
7	Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know how long you go on the computer for? Well get up and go outside. Thats one of my reasons why I think people spend to much time on it my other reason is your eyesit can go bad. Its a nice sunny day dont wast your time on the computer! Go outside! All, kids @CAPS1 is sit on the computer all day not getting exercis. Did you know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids that sit on the computers all day gain at least @NUM3? @PERSON1 told me that. I mean I believe him because its true kids dont get up.There missing a nice day out would you wanna miss a nice sunny day? My finall reason is kids eyesight can go bad. I mean having them stare at a screen all day, thats bad. @PERSON1 told me if your on the computer for @NUM4 hours on the computer for @NUM4 hours straight your eyes can get worst. I remember a tiny when I was on the computer for @NUM4 1/@NUM4 hours my eyes were killing me everything I blink. I know the computer is fun playing games, talking to friends but you should take a break and @CAPS1 something ples. In conclusion just go outside and have fun! @CAPS1 you want to wast a nice sunny day by staying in doors hurting your eyes? I know I @CAPS1!
12	The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational, the computer is the future plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that, paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances, such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of &quot;@CAPS2&quot;, people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a @CAPS3. Where would be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows &quot;good&quot; websites to be viewed, and &quot;bad&quot; on potentially dangerous @CAPS4 to be binded. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites, includes content considered &quot;detrimental&quot; to humans. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminate, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up. Lastly, when viewed carefully, computers are very reliable, and can be made extremely safe, which eliminates the main fear computers. We have come so far to create such a safe, beneficial, and necessary device, we must put it to use, and by doing so, better our own lives, and the life of @ORGANIZATION1.
0	She will go back to where she started. Its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.
1	NO IMAGE
2	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,” ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It’s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, “Not like the kind we had before,” this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,
2	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.
3	Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have.
1	The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will &quot;take that test again&quot;, she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story.
2	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.
1	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepare for this test, because she was not accustom to the place, but after seeing the plants that reminded her of home, and knowing that the spring time is when more will blossom, she will be ready to take the test over.
1	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.
1	The author concludes the story with &quot;when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take thattest again&quot;. To show that Saeng is going to take the test again and is not going to give up. This is shown by saying, &quot;then I will take that test again&quot;. This shows that she has not given up and wants to try again.  
8	Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for spicific reasons. One reason is that many people lose family or to be more spicific lose contact with people. Then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers. Plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing. Many of us young kids say that myspace and facebook is a bad place. Actually its not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notife other doctors that something wrong with a patient or give a visual of the bereathing. Workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if theres any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there. If i was a capenter of a real estate agent I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are avalable to use or thats sold. Or I would give them different house to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for gps so i can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reason. Such as pog, cheatcodes, @CAPS1 cards and other thing. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You newer know what would happen. In conclusion, This is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are for if somthing happens. To you and you don't have a phone use a computer. Also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of how it related to when Saeng failed her driving test. But she was determind to take it over when she feels shes. ready and the paragraph sad &quot;in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.&quot;
1	In the story “Winter Hibiscus” which was wrote by Minfong Ho. I believe she put it there because it keeps you asking questions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her that maybe she can change things and make things better.
2	The author ends the story by saying “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother “noticed the tear staie on her daughter’s cheeks and her puffy eyes.” Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. 
2	I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says “many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become….. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.
0	The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.
2	The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.” Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom.
2	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it’s winter and the hibiscus hasen’t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.
0	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it’s saying that she can’t work in the garden in winter, but “when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,“ are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implys that she will work in the garden.
0	The author concludes the story like this @CAPS2 the Author (Minfong Ho) is telling you what will happen in spring time. I @CAPS1 this @CAPS2 the text say's Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again. This means that in spring the hibiscus will @CAPS3.
1	because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place
8	Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instanly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too. I like, computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When your on the computer you are alot less socal than you would be if you not on the computer. On don't know about you but alot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on an they stay on forever. The act like it is a neccesity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1 and here is why. Compters get really annoyting sometimes. They distract people alot. Like the other day my sister and I were going to @NUM1 walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have socal skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are going socal skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They @MONTH1 not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person.
2	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng’s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng’s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.
1	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.
1	She see if her plant will survive then the winter just like the ones back at home.. And she things will be the. Same.
1	Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. That’s when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test.
1	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won’t give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.
3	Throughout this story we are given background information on a girl who deferately misses her true home when we are first introduced to young saeng she is in a flourist’s shop simply looking at flowers, we soon learn that she is not only  looking at flowers but looking a pieces of her home and past, she then purchases a hibiscus which is a flower native to her vietnam. After discovering that she has just failed a test it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that satement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring saeng  will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests
2	The author concludes the story with this  paragraph  because,Saeng  is determined  to  pass the test. She knows when its spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test I think she wants to retake the test because  the  hibiscus makes her think about her homeland. It makes her feel more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus  makes  her  happy and overwhelmed. She wants to retake the test. She’s sure she will do better next time.
2	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It’s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That’s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  
1	Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. As in the reading she says, &quot;As if oblivious to the cold, he mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Thats the reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter.
1	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.
9	Dear Newspaper, People should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time. People would be more fit, have closer bonds with their family, and get better grades in school. People will alway get fit faster if they excersise instead of staying on the computer. When the computer is unpluged, anyone has a chance to go out side and play. When people go outside to play with their friends, they excersise which causes you to lose weight. @NUM1 scientist believe that it is better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monontenious videos. People would be more active if they stay of the computer and went outside because it will keep you happy with your body, and healthy so you don't die of a terrible diseases. Their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer. Family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers. Your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day. Your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you did this by computer, all you see is a persons face who can't comfort you with a hug. Without computers, you get a closer family that loves and supports each other, but with computers, people just drive their families away. Closer families also help children in school get better grades. Families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades. @NUM2 scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids get better grades in school from staying of the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could get great inventions that can help mankind in every single way. All of can happen from staying off of computers. Staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to. It would get people fit, create closer bonds, and create more gradutes who go on and achieve the greatest of all inventions. Imagine what else could happen by staying of computers.
0	He concludes the story because he was another chance to etact the test.
2	The author concluded &quot;Winter Hibiscus&quot; with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth &amp; another start from the cold, hard winter. The author takes this to heart including, more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. the author has uses structured choice to carry her toughts. Recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like &quot;the gesse return&quot; and &quot;take the test again&quot; which add to the importance at the home. Also, the literal action of the &quot;hibiscus is budding&quot; @CAPS1 rebirth. In winter the plant is dormant &amp; less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds. The author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph.
3	In the story “winter hibiscus” by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country &amp; is having a hard time adapting to the new land &amp; its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning &amp; you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, “almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.” This shows that has finally has found comfort &amp; is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, &amp; then will come back, &amp; that the winter hibiscus new gives up &amp; will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.
1	She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.
0	The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion showed for example the word again it means that you did something already and it's over but you miss so you retry what you miss, but in the paragraph it's talking about the nature and how they want to test it!(&quot;again&quot;)!.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.
2	In the short story &quot;Winter Hibiscus,&quot; a young girl from vietnam moves to @LOCATION1 and fails the drivers test. After she decides to spend money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, The ending paragraph, &quot;who troy come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. shows deep feeling towards nature. She feels as when the Geese we ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud so will she and she will take to drivers test again.
1	She is talking about the flowers and win she says test I think she means how she looks  and exameans the flowers and see the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is some one how admayers flowers a lot or maybe just this one hibiscus and how it buddies. Maybe she is just some one how likes to see changes.
2	I believe the author adds this passage to the Story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2 she is determined and willing to try and. adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will Bring foregiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into american @CAPS1, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her @CAPS4 to home.
6	Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people have computers in there house hold but they disagrees with a computer can help you. There are some advantages in useing computers such as being able to search information able learn hand-eye coordination, becomeing organized, but it also has it's disadvangtages like children spending more time on the computer rather than going out side and playing with friends and exersizeing and staying fit. I agree with computers do produce a positive impact on children. Computers not only let a child stay in contact with their family that live faraway but it can also help them get a progect done more eveficantly and quickly. It @MONTH1 seem that where are doing one thing but when in fact we can be uploading pictures and movies, downloading muisc and playing games at the same. Now with all that I have told you @DATE1 I hope that we share the same point of veiws on computers like how they are good to have and their positive in part.
3	The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. &quot;A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.&quot; But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're &quot;almost familiar&quot;. The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese &amp; the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one.
0	She wanted to learn, and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother got the plant, went home, and they started planting it. The daughter loved the plant very much. And she said that next year I’ll grew a plant as wonderful as the oh her mom was growing.
0	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn’t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore. In what happen was just her past and will be memorable to Saeng.
3	The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus “The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng [she] could almost feel. The light sounds of her grandmother’s long gray hair&quot; This @CAPS1 that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also @CAPS1 how much she missed her homeland. &quot;d-d failed the test that Saeng paid.” @CAPS1 the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. at the end of the story she said that &quot;I [she] will late the test again.&quot; seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leaver knowing that they will return gives Saeng hope. the last time in the story @CAPS1 the regard they @CAPS2 will always remember her homeland  
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isn't going to give up.
0	With the hibiscus around Saeng she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her. Of her old homeland. The reason I think the author choose to end the story with the paticular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land.  
1	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.
2	In the story the “winter Hibiscus” by minfong Ho the writers ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @CAPS1 she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng  @CAPS1 not given up on her drivers test. “… Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This explains in more details when  she will take the test Again another years on is because it leaves the reader to think how the rest of the story will go.
2	I belive that the author concludes the story with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, was a great way to end it becase I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said “You what?” “Her mother stared at her incredulously”. Sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test.
0	The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. that’s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again.
9	Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Experts say that computers are &quot;taking over people&quot;, I strongly disagree. People spend the amount of time they need and want then become active or spend time with family and friends. Computers allow people to learn, they allow people communicate to family and friends, too. Also, @CAPS5 people use computers for work and jobs. I believe computers allow people, like myself, to learn. You can learn also @CAPS5 things on the computer. You can learn about other countries, you can read articles on news, also. You can learn different languges and about the world. Online people can communicate with others. There is skype, which allows you to communicate with others while on the internet, you use a webcam. there is also instant messanger, or @CAPS3. @CAPS3 is like having a conversation with a person who's right next to you! Then there is email which can send letters, photos and comments. @CAPS5 people use computers for work. Microsoft @CAPS4 allows you to type stories and type letters. @CAPS5 people do job reports on @CAPS4. Also, the internet is helpful for work. Websites and search engines help you a lot. Websites can contain information that working people need. To finish this letter, I want to say that @NUM1) Computers allow people to learn. @NUM2) They allow people to communicate with friends and family. Lastly, @NUM3) @CAPS5 working people use the computer for work and reports. I hope I influenced you to see why computers aren't bad.
2	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says “when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.” The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.
1	the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.
1	The author leaves us at the end of the story saying “when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author is said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that remined her of her home. She was happy, but the plant were not exactly like the one from home. But she got used to it. The flower @MONTH1 not be the same but it’s an @CAPS1 flower and she is getting used to beining in @LOCATION1. When she goes back to take the test she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will full of life.
1	I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.
3	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles. 
1	The author chose to conclude the story like that because sheâ€™s saying that it isnâ€™t over and sheâ€™s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says â€œI- I failed the testâ€ so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.
1	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.
3	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.
1	In the story “winter hibiscus” by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite &amp; they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don’t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn’t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says “when they come back then I will take the test again,“ that’s showing she isn’t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.
1	In the story “the Winter Hibiscus&quot;, I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example “when the show melts and the geese return&quot;, The last sentences, then I will take the test again”, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way.
8	I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science. One of my interests in reading, @CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I recieved it back. I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get on A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for on end. I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, &quot;@CAPS3 @CAPS4.&quot; @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers.
2	The author conclude the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is going to retake the test over when all these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.
0	The author concludes the story with  the last paragraph of the story. When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibisous is budding, their i will take that test again.
0	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up
2	In ‘Winter Hibiscus’, the author concludes with Saeng saying ‘I will take that test, again, it means that Saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too. In the end, its revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland.
1	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows he determination. In the spring it will be hard for the hibiscus to survive because its a winter hibiscus and it also has determination.
2	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, “it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here” @CAPS1 it’s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.
3	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, “Winter Hibiscus” to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. “A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng’s eyes now swept over her.” Saeng’s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. “When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    
2	The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with &quot;wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did.
3	The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not “at home,” that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway’s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.
1	I think that she was that way to say, hey I didn’t over come something and I’ll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year.
10	Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers these days have made positive changes to all of our every day lives. People have made beter connections with family and friends, and even have the ability to make new ones. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional-looking. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited. And reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier. I remember making a @CAPS2 with my best friend back when we were in @NUM1 grade. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A-. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you. The computer is a positive advance in society, and everyone should be assured so!
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again.
0	When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again. When Saeng says “Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all.
2	The authors choice of the last paragraph in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus shows the hope for the future that seang feels. The winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her driver’s license. In the spring she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again. She will feel ready to take her test again “when they came back. This shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories. The last paragraph proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move on
1	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.
1	The author conclude the story with the paragraph &quot;when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She realize she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns.
2	Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her. Native plants of her home. “There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, &quot; &quot; &quot; “floating in the bucket.” Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, and this symbolizes change. “Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.” Spring is a time for new beginnings, &quot;when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.” When the familiar object is at it's best, she will be her best and be able to face anything. Winter is the “getting-ready” stage.
1	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, “when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again.
0	I’ll think the author tried two say wean it coming two snow melt like @MONTH1 they she will be come back. Author will because in the spring sometime to written a new book.
2	The author of”Winter Hibiscus “uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of saeng‘s future .Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons.  For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver’s test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   
1	The author of ,”Winter Hibiscus ,” concludes the story with the paragraph,” When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again .”The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader  understand  the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means.
10	Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 is true that more and more people use computers, which in sure you're aware of, but is @CAPS3 really nessesary. I use my computer, I used to use @CAPS3 all the time, but then I got into sports like skateboarding and snow boarding so now i got away from @CAPS3. Yet, @CAPS4 are many many people that still use them and i believe that people should really try to stop going on as much because you could start to get big @PERSON1 fat, @CAPS4 are way better thing to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air. First is that @CAPS3 is possible for you to get big @PERSON1 fat, being fat is not a good thing @CAPS3 could actually be heart breaking because they can't help @CAPS3, and i feel really bad for them. I have a few friends that are over weight like @PERSON1, @PERSON1 is a very over weight kid, he was about @NUM1 lbs whe nhe was @NUM2, I have not seen him in like a year and we had some good @CAPS2, but I do feel really bad because he is very over weight and @CAPS3 is terrible, @PERSON1 does not even know how to ride a bike, nobody would teach him anyways because he doesn't have a father and his mother is over weight as well and as fat as his sister. see her anymore. So being over weight is bad and sitting and playing on the computer will make @CAPS3 worse. Next is @CAPS4 are way better things to do than sit around on the computer all day, messing around on the computer all day is like saying in just going to throw my life away. Instead of being on the computer you could be with friends whether @CAPS3 is shopping sports youre still moving and that is way better then being on the computer trust me. Go for a walk @PERSON1 some thing just try to get yourself dumb, but still fun, computer. I will @CAPS3's fun @CAPS4 are many many thing to do on the computer. Most importantly is that @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air, being outside is a definatly amazing thing to do, you could be walking, be on trampoline, @PERSON1 skateboarding anything is better then being on the computer, even just sitting @CAPS4 on a rock outside is good for your body cause you need to got fresh air in your system. Just do something that involves being outside @CAPS3 is so much fun. So all you computer lovers get off and have some fun being outside with friends @PERSON1 your family. I hope you all listen to me and take my advice so remember @CAPS3 is very possible to get fat, @CAPS4 are way better things to do then sit around on the computer all day, and @CAPS3 is good to be outside getting some fresh air.
1	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said “I failed,” talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said “its not like the one at home.” That’s why the author concludes this paragraph.
0	“When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that’s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them.
2	In the text, when the mother said “It’s flowers aren’t as pretty, but it’s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That’s what matter” This sentences shows that Saeng is just like the flowers. They’re strong to live through the winter, that shows they are very pretty and strong in the spring. This amphasis that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring. That’s why the author put it in at the end. It’s also reflected to the flower, how they’re pretty and strong in spring
0	In the short story, “Winter Hibiscus,” by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. “Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?” When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that “in the spring” when “this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles.  It stands for survival and endurance through life’s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver’s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author’s choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saeng’s ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.
1	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn’t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote “in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again”. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.
1	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. 
1	The author finished the story with, “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.” The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.
2	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn’t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn’t giving up. Another example is when it says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.” Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.
0	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She like spending time with her mom, she likes plants, she likes having fun with her mom. This are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph.
8	Has your daughter or son ever asked you that they want computer in their school? Were you ever baffled when they said they were talkking about @CAPS2 in the school, that they can teach hand eye coordination, gives them the ability to learn from far away places, or even allow them to talk to people all around the world? What did you think about that? Did you agree? If you did then your thinking about the positive side and not the negative. Many reasons why I don’t agree. Saftey, the money, health. Many people said that its good to interact with other people but not all the time if your son or daughter interacts with people they @CAPS1 know are you going to be worried.? They can be asked who they are, were they live. Sometimes they even ask if they can meet up face to face. My friend @PERSON2 said her school got those computers and her friend @PERSON3 was asked to meet or with somebody she never knew and she ended up saying yes and @PERSON2 says she nevered showed up. Would you ever want that to happen to your child? Well this is only the begining. Once your child’s school gets computers they will be addicted to @CAPS2, @PERSON1 said that &quot;if a child does not go out and enjoy there childhood but they want concentrate on their homework, they will just eat and be on the computer eventually they will become obese.” @CAPS2 is very imperative that your child does go out and have fun and get exercise because then they will just be on the computers @NUM1. Have you ever wondered that? Another thing is the school will have to pay alot of money, if your child ever damages the computers then you will also have to pay a lot of money too. Not only if your childs school gets computers @CAPS2 will benefit you guys alot. I trolly and sincerly do not belive that students should get computers. Also your students computers @MONTH1 get viruses because of inappropriate sites. Then your going to pay for that as well. Lastly the school will not have enough money for materials. What will you do?!? Your child is not there to be addicted to computers your child is there for education! Do you still support these computers!? I hope not because there is a @PERCENT1 chance that they will or will not get @CAPS2. Hopefully I gave you enough information about the saftey, money and health. This is very urgent situation so please be aware.
3	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes “she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs” after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of “combing her grandmother’s long grey hair, freshly washed” it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn’t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was “exquisite” and as she said the @CAPS1 word “dokor malik” meaning hibiscus she “savored the feel of the word on her tongue.” @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when “the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.
3	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it’s because it’s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she’ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant’s situation.
3	“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.” This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng’s situation in the short story, “Winter Hibiscus.” Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.” This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.
2	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story “the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair.” you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, “it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.” She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her “@CAPS1 Malik” flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.  
0	She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is makeing new friends and doing good on the test and classes. In the paragraph it said “Then I will take that test again.” That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school.  
2	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a ‘test’,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. ”A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her.&quot; She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng’s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future.
1	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.
2	I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. “It’s not a real one,” Saeng mumbled. ‘I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. “But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive’s test one more try. “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.&quot;
2	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,&quot;... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now&quot;. I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, &quot;when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding”, she gains more confidence because she leds like she’s back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.
2	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.
10	Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever gone somewhere, taken pictures, and posted them on the computer? If you have you will remember where you visited. But atleast you went to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1 or somewhere. There are some people who are on the computer all day. Instead of experiencing nature and taken on @CAPS1 life brings to them, they are on facebook or youtube all day. This disgusts me because there are many fun, beautiful, and entertainings things to do. In @CAPS2 opinion I think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family. Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit ther and do nothing about there lives. First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might eating doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say &quot;@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?&quot; @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on there butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outsite for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a meal with @CAPS2 family and then just sit down, relax, and talk. Also some people don't get sleep becuse they are &quot;doing something important&quot; and miss a family trip or even school. In conclusion I believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing nature, and not enjoying company of family &amp; friends.
8	Dear: local newspars @CAPS1 recently been brought my attendchon, that people should use computers. My three arugment are they tach hand - eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allow People to talk on line with other people. @CAPS1 tachs people hand-eye coordination because when people type on the kyebord the more and more ther type on the kyebord and the faster and faster. Mach people have more coordinion first, they get used to typeing then, they start typeins fast last when they type fast @CAPS1 give them more hand-eye coordinion. Useins computers give people the ability to learn about far away Places and people because they could such google people and places then @CAPS1 show a lot of wedsite then when they go on one wedsite they type in the person name and state then @CAPS1 show them the places of person. Computers give people the ability to talk with people from other place like aim, myspace or face book and people could play games and talk at the same time so the computer is very poplure this time because of what people mack there wedsite do and this is why I think people should use computer far a lot of like my three @CAPS2 so @CAPS1 been to my attenchon that people should use computer for three reson i is tach hand - Coordination give people the ability to learn abount far away places and people, and even allow people to talk online withe other people so this is why I sajust people should use computer.
1	The auther ended the story with that preticular paragraph because like the geese she will be back to try again. Just in case she didn’t get to finish JUST about everything she wanted to do and that the auther wanted the reader to know the determination and ambition of the character in the story. Also to show the readers that the characters characteristics couldn’t be beat by one winter and that she is going to keep going at it untill she does what she has to do.
3	The author of the story “Winter Hibiscus” most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. “She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.” Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng’s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, “then I will take that test again.“you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,”the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,” and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.
1	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.
1	The auther mad it seem like he did not like it but he loved flowers and he like working in the syr wit the people his mom is anierpaady he liked to see him togod wit his life that come back becus thay liked the place.
1	The auther includes this at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and that she seils brought back her back to her childhood. An example of her loving the plant is that rich scent&quot; (Paragraph Minfong Ho), @CAPS1 examples “It felt smooth and cool” (paragraph Minfong Ho) An example of to childhood's plan is that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten. she come back we could reed (paragraphs Minfong Ho) For these ways think that is why the author adds that at the end.
2	I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read, so it will be a message. In the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture. The only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little vow to herself was a message to not give up. Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts over then so will I. Also it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new begging because in the text, it says,
0	I think the author wrote that because maybe that how she fells like in the winter she could really show people who she is but when spring come out she like a flower that has been dead all winter  
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the “winter hibiscus” and the geese. So the author just simply writes another concluding paragraph that just wraps the story up, and the reader walkes away with a feel good feeling.
3	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.” This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.     
0	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there watste.

8	Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed on our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. this shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunatly, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. this is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet. 
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads “when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.” She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.
0	The reason why the said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if she’s still like the bitter melon over the Big-mac.
1	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.
1	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more.
1	What the author concludes that in the spring time when the snows melts and the flower comes back it makes be risk of spring time at home. Which makes her relax. Also spring time is a more pretty time because all the flowers are out and the flower that reminds her at home blessings.
1	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. Saeng is going to wait to take the test whe n she knows that she will past the test so she can get her licesned. Saeng wants her licesned so she can drive anywhere she wants to go. So she don't have to get her mom to take her everywhere she wants to go she can take her ownself anywhere she wants. But she has to wait till the snows is melted before she takes her test again.
0	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.
1	The author concludes the story with this parapraph because it ties it all together. I think that the author uses. it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says &quot;…in the spring, when the snows melt….&quot; I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it.
2	The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this “test” once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope, good memories, and fresh start.
0	The would grow some flowers and water the geese come back to her pond.
9	Dear local newspaper writer, I'm writting to talk to you about the use of computers. I think computers benifit our comunties a lot. I feel this way because it can warn us about a natural disaster. It teaches us about everything &amp; everything. Last we get to talk to people online In these next paragraphs ill share my thoughts about this topic to you. My first reason is natural disasters. Computers always warn us about them. For example when hurricane katrina hit computers were able to see that on their. Many people was able to flee the city before that happened. States shows @PERCENT1 of the natural disasters computer classified them. Computers saves people live eaach &amp; every. Another example is with the earthquakes that recently happened in @LOCATION1. Computers informed many people about them. Those were my reasons how computers warn us about natural disasters. My second reason why I say computers benifit us is because it teaches us about everything &amp; anything we learn about faraway places, new word &amp; things that is happening in our own country. For example I had to research a person my project &amp; all I dis was type in his name &amp; pages full of information popped. You will be amazal how much information the computer has. Comuter has everything you need on as person &amp; so much more. this is my second reason why computers are helpful. My last reason we get to talk online. Now the has its pros &amp; cons. Talking online is very fun. I mean you in many website, myspace, facebook, twitter. Its never ending. People can talk to old friends, family anybody really. But many people have to be careful cause their creeps out ther. Like say you can't meet up with you friend you can @ORGANIZATION1 or ooVoo (webcame) them. The computer is you friend. So you might as well make good use with it. This is my last reason now the computer can benifit you. In conclusion I think the computer makes the world that much easier. My reason why you ask. It warns us about, natural disaster. It teaches us everything &amp; anything. Last up can talk online.
2	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS “THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.”, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY.
3	I believe the author concludes the story “Winter Hibiscus”, written by Minfong Ho, with “When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again”, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story “Winter Hibiscus” with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.
2	The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feel like she's at home. When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states “run and the geese return&quot; this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again”. Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home.Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. Thats why the author concluded with this pasage.
0	Why the author concluded with this paragraph was because it showed a restated the main idea of the story and the readers understood what the story was about. That is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.
1	The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow it's lovely peddles back. As she tells her mother “that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back.
0	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time.
0	The author concludes the Story with this paragraph because I guess her grandma died while the geese were flying. Or thats when the flowers start to bloom.
3	The author of “Winter Hibiscus” included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. &quot;It’s-it’s not a real one, ‘Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at’ she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again.&quot; She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.” One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother’s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb.&quot; The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. “Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.” The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. “Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.” Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus.
1	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn’t do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did.
1	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. Also, with an ending of that sort it kind of leaves room for improving and room for a sequal.
7	I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day.
1	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. “But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn’t cost that much!” Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. “Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the “winter hibiscus” into it.” This shows that even though she had failed she wasn’t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her.
